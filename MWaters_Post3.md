# Growing Pains for Growing Brains: Evaluating YA Literature

Do adolescents and young adults need or deserve their own subcategory of fiction? What guidelines do authors need to write responsibly for teens and pre-teens? Books, like many forms of media, appeal to multiple demographics. Wherever there are demographics, however, there is in-fighting among habitual readers of different factions.
