# Growing Pains for Growing Brains: Evaluating YA Literature

Do adolescents and young adults need or deserve their own subcategory of fiction? What guidelines do authors need to write responsibly for teens and pre-teens? Books, like many forms of media, appeal to multiple demographics. Wherever there are demographics, however, there are disputes among members of the group and across culture as a whole.

From a marketing standpoint, any book targeted at teens or pre-teens is classified as young adult (YA) literature. Several genres exist under the umbrella of YA, of course, but the generational divide in narrative preference has drawn some ire from older members of the bookworm community.

Media critic Lindsay Ellis, partnering with PBS, narrates a [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn3aKZ8ZVFo) on the history (evolution) of YA literature. In it, she comments on the inherent bias present from the genre's inception: "So while young adult fiction was plenty lucrative, it wasn't really respected by people outside of its targeted readership. It was low art&mdash;for kids!" Ellis goes on to cite the Harry Potter series as the watershed collection that legitimized the genre, but controversy continues.

In 2017, the Huffington Post allowed teenaged intern Vivian Parkin DeRosa to provide an inside perspective on the literary movement. The piece is aptly titled ["I'm A Teenager And I Don't Like Young Adult Novels. Here's Why."](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-ya-gets-wrong-about-teenagers-from-a-teen_us_594a8e4de4b062254f3a5a94) She begins her critique with a disclaimer: "Let me say, this is NOT because I think YA isn't real literature." In all fairness to DeRosa, I must point out that she does not see the issue of the genre's worth in black and white. Instead, she chooses both to enjoy and to evaluate books marketed to her. She composes a list of YA's most exhausting cliches. For example: poorly-written slang, unrealistic beauty standards (among **adolescent** characters no less), oversimplified social hierarchies made her lineup of grievances. DeRosa refuses to view the genre with uncritical eyes, and I respect that mindfulness. YA's young readers are not the only group voicing their opinions online, though.

The issue is so significant that the American Library Association issued an [official white paper](http://www.ala.org/yalsa/guidelines/whitepapers/yalit) on the merits of YA literature. The paper references YA sympathetially throughout the text. "That period of passage called 'young adulthood' is a unique part of life," reads the text. "By addressing these needs," the piece continues, "young adult literature is made valuable not only by is artistry but also by its relevance to the lives of its readers."

The best summary of the ALA's white paper comes in its conclusion: "For all of these reasons the Young Adult Library Services Association values young adult literature, believes it is an indispensable part of public and school library collections, and regards it as essential to healthy youth development and the corollary development of healthy communities in which both youth and libraries can thrive." To support the youth-centric genre, the ALA formed the Young Adult Library Services Association as a YA branch; the branch is referenced several times within the paper.

> **Editorial:** I am admittedly partial to YA literature. Having discovered Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & the Olympians series in my late teens, I found both entertainment and inspiration in the young heroes' quests as I sought to find my stride post-high school. *Any* genre can become problematic when tropes replace intelligence in the minds of authors, but the vertigo-inducing years between childhood and adulthood deserve to be addressed. I believe&mdash;and celebrate the fact that&mdash;YA is here to stay.
