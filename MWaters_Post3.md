# Growing Pains for Growing Brains: Evaluating YA Literature

Do adolescents and young adults need or deserve their own subcategory of fiction? What guidelines do authors need to write responsibly for teens and pre-teens? Books, like many forms of media, appeal to multiple demographics. Wherever there are demographics, however, there is in-fighting among habitual readers of different factions.

From a marketing standpoint, any book targeted at teens or pre-teens is classified as young adult (YA) literature. Several genres exist under the umbrella of YA, of course, but the generational divide in narrative preference has drawn some ire from older members of the bookworm community.

Media critic Lindsay Ellis, parterning with PBS, narrates a [video essay](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn3aKZ8ZVFo) on the history (evolution) of YA literature. In it, she comments on the inherent bias present from the genre's inception: "So while young adult fiction was plenty lucrative, it wasn't really respected by people outside of its targeted readership. It was low art&mdash;for kids!" Ellis goes on to cite the Harry Potter series as the watershed collection that legitimized the genre, but controversy continues.

In 2017, the Huffington Post allowed teenaged intern Vivian Parkin DeRosa to provide an inside perspective on the literary movement. The piece is aptly titled ["I'm A Teenager And I Don't Like Young Adult Novels. Here's Why."](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-ya-gets-wrong-about-teenagers-from-a-teen_us_594a8e4de4b062254f3a5a94) She begins her critique with a disclaimer: "Let me say, this is NOT because I think YA isn't real literature." In all fairness to DeRosa, I must point out that she does not see the issue of the genre's worth in black and white. Instead, she chooses both to enjoy and to evaluate books marketed to her. She composes a list of YA's most exhausting cliches. For example: poorly-written slang, unrealistic beauty standards (among **adolescent** characters no less), oversimplified social hierarchies made her catalog of grievances. DeRosa refuses to view the genre with uncritical eyes, and I respect that mindfulness. YA's young readers are not the only group voicing their opinions online, though.

The issue is so significant that the American Library Association issued an official white paper on the merits of YA literature. Ironically, the institution upholds the genre from which the demographic insider (DeRosa) chose to distance herself.

> **Editorial:** I am admittedly partial to YA literature. Having discovered Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson & the Olympians series in my late teens, I found both entertainment and inspiration in the young heroes' quests as I sought to find my stride post-high school. *Any* genre can become problematic when tropes replace intelligence in the minds of authors, but the vertigo-inducing years between childhood and adulthood deserve to be addressed. I believe&mdash;and celebrate the fact that&mdash;YA is here to stay.
