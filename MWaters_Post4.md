# Up in Flames: Book-Burning Blues

Every avid reader has a pet peeve when it comes to book marring. Some cannot stand to spill beverages on the pages. Some hate to see a tome with water damage. For some, the sight of a dog-eared page can ruin the reading experience. Now imagine a bonfire. . . with controversial books as kindling.

That act of violent censorship has taken place too many times throughout history in an effort to suppress undesirable ways of thinking. Most notable in modern remembrance are the 1933 Book Burnings. During these assemblies, students of German universities gathered to set flame to piles of literature that the Third Reich had deemed unethical, including every detectable trace of Jewish scholars' work. The United States Holocaust Memorial Musuem's [website](https://www.ushmm.org/collections/bibliography/1933-book-burnings#h16) provides an overview of the events and a list of books for continued research.

Jon Henley of The Guardian uses the 1933 Book Burnings as the centerpiece in his [2010 article](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/sep/10/book-burning-quran-history-nazis) on the practice. He then revisits several of history's major book-burners, from Chinese Emperor Qin Shi Huang to the Spanish Inquisition to Pastor Terry Jones's failed Burn-a-Koran Day in 2010. "There's something uniquely symbolic about the burning of books," says Henley. "It goes beyond the censoring of beliefs and ideas. A book, plainly, is something more than ink and paper, and burning one (or many) means something more than destroying it by any other means." When books (a symbol of sophistication and culture) are ruined by fire (a primal force of nature), it is a triumph of prehistorical instinct over modernity.

> **Editorial:** Burning a book will not cause the ideas to cease&mdash;especially not in the digital age. The beautiful thing about the modernized world is that we have the freedom to test the meddle of beliefs by debating them. Any ideology worth considering can and should stand its ground under multicultural analysis. People of any belief system must "fight" by winning arguments again and again throughout history; it is impossible to make the other side's beliefs disappear through mere arson. Let us choose conversation over combustion.
