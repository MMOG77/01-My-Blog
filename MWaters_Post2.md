# N-Word Contemplation: Twain Versus Censorship
> **Note:** The sources I cite in this post include the n-word in its entirety. I will not do so in this blog. (For a full statement of my stance on the issue, see the editorial section of the post.)

In 2011, Dr. Allen Gribben caused a stir in the literary community when he announced that he would publish an altered version of *Huckleberry Finn*, arguably [one of the most controversial books](https://www.ila.org/initiatives/banned-books-week/books-challenged-or-banned-in-2016-by-ro) in the history of the United States. Gribben sought to make the novel more accesible by replacing Twain's [219](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hetertqebu-walters/educate-dont-censure-the-_b_806601.html) uses of *n&mdash;* with the less-volatile term *slave*. The revised edition met with almost universal disapproval from literary critics.

"[T]he idea of changing the language in the novel in order to boost its popularity," [remarks](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/05/huckleberry-finn-edition-censors-n-word) Benedicte Page of The Guardian, "is still viewed with bafflement in many quarters." Michiko Kakutani of the New York Times [addresses Gribben's censorship](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/books/07huck.html) in a more straightforward, confrontational manner: "Mr. Gribbenâ€™s effort to update 'Huckleberry Finn' . . . ratifies the narcissistic contemporary belief that art should be inoffensive and accessible . . . ." Hetert-Qebu Walters of the Huffington Post brings her personal, pedagogical experience to the subject. She [reminisces](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/hetertqebu-walters/educate-dont-censure-the-_b_806601.html), "As a history teacher I know firsthand how difficult it is to teach about the antebellum South, but I also know how rewarding it is." She exposed her students to the word in literature (but not in the class notes), "allowing them to understand the word as an outgrowth of the dehumanization of a people." Several online journalists who covered the censored edition agree that the word should remain in the text as an anathema to strengthen *Huckleberry Finn* as a cautionary tale.

> **Editorial:** I believe that *Huckleberry Finn*, as a piece of literary history, should retain its n-words for the sake of posterity; however, I do not approve of the slur in the context of modern-day culture. Kakutani, in the New York Times piece, indicates that "today n[&mdash;] is used by many rappers who have reclaimed the word from its ugly past." However, I still regard the term as a regressive label by which the African-American community minimizes its authority in society. Being a mulatto myself, I believe that people of African ancestry should use more respectful language when addressing their race. Such slurs should remain in yesteryear's books, provided that they do not continue to invade today's rhetoric.
