# What's the Point of Page-Turning?

Whether we are always aware of it or not, the media we consume shapes our mindsets&mdash;on a personal scale *and* a cultural level. Every piece of entertainment is like a mixture of juice (the sweet euphoria of escapism) and medication (the media creators' worldview); however, some filmmakers, authors, and musicians misdiagnose their society, adding unhelpful&mdash;or even problematic&mdash; lessons to their recipes. Readers in particular can grow susceptible to suggestions and messages when they lose themselves in the pages of a book.

While this principle is common knowledge among academics, even the most adamant of bookworms can forget about the influence of literature until they come face-to-face with concrete examples. Turning Pages Turning heads exists to remind the literature enthusiasts of the world (myself included) that the books we read, recommend, and assign to students *can* stir the pot of real-world policies.

Every installment of Turning Pages Turning Heads will feature historical instances of literature causing controversy in the public sphere. (Maybe I will focus on one story, or maybe I will compare similar occurrences. I'll try to mix it up.) Every court case or public controversy about a book is a candidate. These posts will include a recap of events. They will also include editorial sections in which I weigh in on the featured topic. At the end of each post, I will leave links for continued reading on the subject, should you be so inclined to launch your own investigation into, and evaluation of, the sources.

Bookworms tend to view reading as a personal experience, and I get it. A quality page-turner can make one's external circumstances seem to melt away as one connects with the inner world. Introspection and imagination are very personal processes. Individual minds cannot contain something as powerful as literature, though. Its influence does impact society as a whole, and responsible book enthusiasts should be aware of the power that a myriad of personal experiences can have.



**Never stop having fun with books, but also never forget the power in the pages.**
