# What's the Point of Page-Turning?

Whether we are always aware of it or not, the media we consume shapes our mindsets&mdash;on a personal scale *and* a cultural level. Every piece of entertainment is like a mixture of juice (the sweet euphoria of escapism) and medication (the media creators' worldview); however, some filmmakers, authors, and musicians misdiagnose their society, adding unhelpful&mdash;or even problematic&mdash; lessons to their recipes. Readers in particular can grow susceptible to suggestions and messages when they lose themselves in the pages of a book.

While this principle is common knowledge among academics, even the most adamant of bookworms can forget about the influence of literature until they come face-to-face with concrete examples. Turning Pages Turning heads exists to remind the literature enthusiasts of the world (myself included) that the books we read, recommend, and assign to students *can* stir the pot of real-world policies.
