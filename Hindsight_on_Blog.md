1. I learned that different flavors of markdown have subtle differences. For example, the combination of *&*, *mdash*, and *;* will create an em dash in GitHub, but Wordpress cannot read this sign. Instead, WordPress automatically converts double hyphens into em dashes.

2. I still do not know how to create special characters in markdown&mdash; like an e with an accent mark or a u with an umlaut (diaresis).
